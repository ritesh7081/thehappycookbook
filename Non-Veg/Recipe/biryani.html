        <p>First, wash the rice nicely and soak it in water for around 20-30 minutes. Drain and keep aside.
        <p>To marinate the chicken, add ginger-garlic paste, yogurt, haldi, red chilli powder, and salt to a bowl.
                Add the chicken pieces and mix well. Let it set for at least an hour.
        <p>Now, heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add saunf, cloves, a cinnamon stick, and cardamom. Saute well.
                Add the onions, ginger, and garlic, and saute until the onions become golden brown in colour.
        <p>To this, add the marinated chicken pieces and cook for a few more minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, green
                chillies, red chilli powder, and haldi. Mix well.
        <p>Next, add the yogurt and coriander leaves. Combine everything together and cook for about 4-5 minutes.
        <p>Now, cover this chicken masala with cooked rice and top it with some fried onions, cashew nuts, and
                raisins. Cover the lid and allow it to cook for 15-20 minutes. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves, and
                serve hot!
