    <div class="just">
        <p>Start by marinating the mutton pieces with all the dry masalas and ginger-garlic paste. Make sure
            everything is well combined, and let it marinate for half an hour.
        <p>Now, add the marinated mutton pieces to a non-stick pan and cook them for a few minutes.
        <p>Once they start to brown, add the chopped onions and tomatoes. Mix well and cook until the onions become
            golden brown.
        <p>If you feel like the mixture is sticking to the pan, add some water and give it a nice mix. Cover the
            pan with a lid and allow it to cook on a low-medium flame until the mutton becomes tender.
        <p>Once done, add garam masala and garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with rice, roti, or naan.
