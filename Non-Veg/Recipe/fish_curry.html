        <p>Wash the fish nicely and then sprinkle salt, red chilli powder, haldi, and oil over it. Rub it well to
            ensure that the fish is well coated. Set aside to marinate for an hour.
        <p>In the meantime, add coriander leaves, green chillies, and garlic cloves to a mixer grinder and blend to
            form a smooth paste.
        <p>Heat oil in a pan and shallow fry the marinated fish pieces evenly from both sides.
        <p>In another pan, add oil along with the prepared coriander paste and some water. Mix well and allow it to
            cook for a few minutes.
        <p>Next, add in the coriander powder, red chilli powder, salt, and tomato puree. Add more water if
            required, and cook until the gravy comes to a boil.
        <p>Arrange the fish pieces in a bowl and pour the gravy over them. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves, and
            serve hot! Sindhi fish curry is ready to be relished.
