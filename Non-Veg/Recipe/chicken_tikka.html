        <p>Start by dry roasting the chickpea flour on low heat for a few minutes. Allow it to cool down, and then
                transfer it to a bowl.
        <p>To this, add yoghurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder, oil, garam masala, ground coriander, and
                salt. Mix well.
        <p>Add the boneless chicken pieces and coat them well with the prepared marinade. Cover the bowl with cling
                wrap and keep it aside for 20-30 minutes.
        <p>Once done, add onions and bell peppers to it and mix well. Now, take a skewer and alternatively thread
                the onion, capsicum, and chicken tikka pieces.
        <p>Repeat until the entire mixture is finished. Preheat your air fryer to 200 degrees C for 2 minutes.
                Place the skewers evenly in the air fryer basket and air fry for 10-15 minutes. Serve hot and enjoy!
